/// A stack view that provides shuffling behaviour to swipe contents to left and right.
///
/// ## Overview
/// `ShuffleStack` is built on top of `ZStack` but it only renders three child views which are visible on the screen and switches data to display based on the current index. In case the data passed into the stack view is empty, there will be empty view on the screen.
///
/// The following example provides the simple usage of `ShuffleStack` which creates a stack of color cards with default shuffle style and animation.
/// ```swift
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     let colors: [Color] = [.blue, .brown, .black, .cyan, .green, .indigo, .pink, .purple, .red, .orange, .yellow]
///     var body: some View {
///         ShuffleStack(
///             colors,
///             initialIndex: 0
///         ) { color in
///             color
///                 .frame(height: 200)
///                 .cornerRadius(16)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Customizing default behaviours
/// `ShuffleStack` comes with various types of modifiers to override default behaviour of the stack view so that it is easy to tailor to view with custom values such as animation, style, offset, padding and scale factor.
///
/// The following table shows a list of available modifiers that customizes the view.
///
/// Modifier | Description
/// --- | ---
/// ``shuffleAnimation(_:)`` | A modifer that overrides default shuffle animation of the shuffle stack view.
/// ``shuffleStyle(_:)`` | A modifer that overrides default shuffle style of the shuffle stack view.
/// ``shuffleOffset(_:)`` | A modifier that sets value that is used to shift the offset of the upcoming and previous content views behind the view of the current index.
/// ``shufflePadding(_:)`` | A modifier that sets horizontal padding to the shuffle stack view.
/// ``shuffleScale(_:)`` | A modifier that sets scale factor to shrink the size of the upcoming and previous content views of stack.
/// ``shuffleDisabled(_:)`` | A modifier that sets scale factor to shrink the size of the upcoming and previous content views of stack.
///
/// ## Observing shuffle events and swiping translation
/// `ShuffleStack` provides handy modifiers that listens shuffle events and swiping translation to perform a particular action based on those values after shuffling succeeds or while swiping stack views.
///
/// The following modifiers helps to observe shuffling events and translation changes.
///
/// Modifier | Description
/// --- | ---
/// ``onShuffle(_:)`` |  A modifier that listens shuffling events occurring on the shuffle stack view.
/// ``onShuffleTranslation(_:)`` | A modifier that listens translation changes while swiping content views.
///
/// ## Triggering shuffling programmatically
/// `ShuffleStack` also allows programmatic shuffling by accpecting a series of events from the upstream publisher. Whenever the publisher fires an event, it blocks user interaction on the view and performs shuffling action.
/// 
/// Modifier | Description
/// --- | ---
/// ``shuffleTrigger(on:)`` | A modifier that accpets events of direction to perform programmatic shuffling.
///
